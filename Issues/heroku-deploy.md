### Time to deploy your app so that you can share it with other people online!
All of these steps can be easily completed in your browser
- Create a [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) account if you don't already have one (it's free, don't worry) 
-  Got into the app.json file and change the **"repository"** to the link to your repository
-  Add a **deploy to heroku** button on your REAME.md like the one below

![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)

The markdown looks like:

`[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template= <url for this repo>)`
- Save your README.md and click on the deploy button
- Give your app a name and deploy it to heroku

If you make any changes you'll want to easily push them to your heroku app so
- Navigate to **deploy**

- And enable automatic deploys. That way anytime you merge a branch to master, the new master will deploy
