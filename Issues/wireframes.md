### What do you want your webpage to look like?
Think of the components (ie. clue, score, etc) you would need to include for the game to function. Add them and any other visual features you wish to include in a [wireframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe). You can use an editing tool you already have or know about like MS Paint or Google Draw or you could checkout some of the free trials for wireframe software like [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/). Have fun and experiment with your design!
