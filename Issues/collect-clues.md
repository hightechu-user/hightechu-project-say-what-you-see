## Clues

Try to think of image sequences that  represent a word or event. Here's an example:

The images are "hair", "repo"(the icon for GitHub repositories), and "otter", which represent Harry Potter.
For now, try and think of image sequences that are the same length. For example I could have another set of 3 images for my next clue that are "Ollie", "limb", "Pick", which represents Olympic. Later, If you want to, you can change the sequence length dynamically, but this is easier to start.
- [ ] Find the images online and save them with a simple straightforward name (you'll have to find them and add them to your code) with no spaces (eg. lego-man.png **not** lego man.png).
- [ ] Save them in `<project-name>/src/Images`.
- [ ] When you're satisfied with your work, create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
