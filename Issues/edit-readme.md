A README is a file that helps explain the usage and purpose of software and it shows on the main page of a GitHub repository. Right now this README exists to help you understand the process of a HighTechU Project Hub Project, but now that your App is looking good and working well, you can change the README.md to reflect the purpose of YOUR app.

### Edit your README.md
- Explain what the purpose of the app is
- Explain how the Game works
- Include a link to the deployed Heroku App
- Take a screenshot (or 3 or 4) or a .gif and include that in the README
- Include any other information you want to share with others

### Add an App Preview
Your App Preview is what people will see when you share your app on social media or when they look at your profile on the Project Hub
- Navigate to settings
- Click **edit** under Social Preview and upload one of the screenshots you took for the README
